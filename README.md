Context
-------

This project's goal is to create a (simplified) clone of _Final Fantasy_'s combat, a game developed
by [_Square Enix_](https://www.square-enix.com)
Broadly speaking for the combat the player has a group of characters to control and a group of 
enemies controlled by the computer.

By the moment, there isn´t much to comment, the MainExample is the class were I instantiated every class in the
source (that needs to be instantiated), and inside the class there are a lot of System.out.prinln(); that guides
the flow of the test. :D
